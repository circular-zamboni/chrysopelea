# What is Chrysopelea?

Zero-infrastructure data storage, collaborative manipulation, analysis,
and visualization, by using Airtable combined with Python running
in the browser.

## What this block does

The Chrysopelea (flying snakes!) block enables the user to define script variables that are populated with user-selected Airtable data to feed into Python scripts. The user defines the script variable names, and what tables/views should be used to populate each variable. The user also defines the table to be used to store the Python scripts. Finally, the user can select a script and run it. Plots generated by the script are rendered in the block, and the script results are displayed. In case of script error, the error is displayed. The user can also define tables to store the results of Python scripts.

## How to remix this block

1. Create a new base (or you can use an existing base).

2. Create a new block in your base (see [Create a new block](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-block),
   selecting "Remix from Github" as your template.

3. From the root of your new block, run `block run`.

## How it works, and credits

99% of the functionality of this block comes from the "Pyodide" project, which
implements Python within the web browser using WebAssembly.

Documentation, source, and license
of "Pyodide" are available at the links below. The "Pyodide" functions
are incorporated by loading "Pyodide" WebAssembly files into your browser.
